# Machine_Learning_2023A

This repository contains a set of exercises for our course ICCD623 Data Mining and Machine Learning 2023-A.

The exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts and techniques learned during the course and provide hands-on practice in Python and R.

## Introduction

Exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience and reinforce the theoretical concepts discussed in the course. Each exercise aims at providing practice and improve students' skills in implementing machine learning algorithms and analyzing real-world datasets.

## Prerequisites

To work with the exercises in this repository, it is recommended to attend classes in order to have a good understanding of data analysis, as well as strong competence in programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
